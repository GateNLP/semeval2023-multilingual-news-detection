Obtaining English translations: 
In order to train the monolingual MUPPET model, you must obtain translations for all non-English data. 

First, call the function produce_joined_data() from st2_utils_acl.py. 
This will save a .tsv file contains all articles from the organizer train and dev set (/st2/processed_data/joined.tsv)
Next, upload joined.tsv to Google translate to obtain English translations. 
Add these translations to the original joined.tsv under the new column 'text_en'.

To train the MUPPET model, run st2/produce_muppet_no_class_weighting_acl.py
